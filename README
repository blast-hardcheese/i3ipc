i3ipc - An Library for i3 IPC Communication


Goals:
* Send commands by IPC to i3 window manager.
* Recieve parsed JSON responses from sent commands.
* Subscribe to i3 event model using a evented model.


Current Status:
The library is currently able to send commands and return JSON response code 
for a given active socket file.


Comments:
I'm not a socket programmer and mostly spend my time with basic Python when
BASH scripting becomes more arcane and Python is less verbose. Because of this
the functions in this module may very well be the last way you'd actually want
to communicate using IPC. Please, let me know if you have any ideas.

For now this library fills the gap for me. There is no current Python library
that I am aware of for communicating with the i3WM.
