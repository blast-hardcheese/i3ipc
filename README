i3ipc - An Library for i3 IPC Communication


Current Status:
    * Send commands by IPC to i3 window manager.
    * Recieve parsed JSON responses from sent commands.
    * Subscribe to i3 events using an evented model.
    * Works with i3 window manager up through next branch in git. (not tested
      with tree)
      
      
Dependencies (tested, may work with others):
 * python 2.7.1

Optional Dependencies:
 * pyxdg 0.19 (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pyxdg)
 * xpyb 1.2 (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xcb/xpyb/)


Events:
    Events are subscribed to by passing a callable method along with a message
 type to the subscribe module method. From then on any generated events will be
 passed to the method and handled by that code.
    Filters can be subscribed along with the original call. A "filter" is
 simply a text string based on change arguments passed along with the events.
 According to http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/ipc.html the following events can be
 filtered with these arguments:

 I3_IPC_EVENT_WORKSPACE Event:
    focus
    init
    empty
    urgent

 I3_IPC_EVENT_OUTPUT Event:
    unspecified

 A comma-seperated list of options can be passed in to the i3ipc program;
 i3ipc -S I3_IPC_EVENT_WORKSPACE,init


Comments:
    Please let me know by email or github submissions if you find any errors or
 have any suggestions. I am interested in improving this library to meet all
 kinds of i3 use-cases.
