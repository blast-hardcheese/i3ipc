i3ipc - An Library for i3 IPC Communication


Goals:
* Send commands by IPC to i3 window manager.
* Recieve parsed JSON responses from sent commands.
* Subscribe to i3 event model using a evented model.


Current Status:
The library is complete. It can send and receive individual commands and
subscribe to events with optional filters.


Comments:
For now this library fills the gap for me. There is no current Python library
that I am aware of for communicating with the i3WM. If you find any issues with
this library please email me patches or submit them on github.
